## Overview

### The challenge

Build an interactive app that lets you play a Blackjack Game. App should:

- Mainmenu which has a start game button and displays player profile as well as chips.
- Game-UI that displays the cards and sum as well as the draw and skip buttons.
- Victory and Defeat Interface that displays the victory and defeat message as well as two buttons: Play Again and Main Menu which lets you restart the game and go to the main menu, respectively.
- Victory will increase the player's chips. While Defeat does the opposite. Victory and Defeat should also update the chips display.
- Game should reset if restarted.
- Game should be responsive.
